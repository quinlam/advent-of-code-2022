# advent-of-code-2022

Welcome to the Advent of Code[^aoc] Kotlin project created by [quinlam][github] using the [Advent of Code Kotlin Template][template] delivered by JetBrains.

In this repository, quinlam is about to provide solutions for the puzzles using [Kotlin][kotlin] language.

If you're stuck with Kotlin-specific questions or anything related to this template, check out the following resources:

- [Kotlin Slack][slack]
- Template [issue tracker][issues]

## Goals

My goal for this advent of code is to write readable and non-brute force code, but not necessarily highly optimized. I would favor readability and maintainability
over optimization. I am also looking to favor functional operations for the solutions.


[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-five days.
    You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
